One of the biggest discussions nowadays is about meritocracy and how your own effort leads you to sucess. On the other hand, this raises a deeper and harder discussion on where we start on the journey of life. It's really hard to think that someone born in a favela will have the some opportunities as the son of a great salesman and doesn't have to worry with getting a job and helping his family paying the bills.
