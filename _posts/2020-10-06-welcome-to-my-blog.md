Hi! My name is **Rafael Bernardes Gonçalves**, and I'm creating this blog to share some data science projects and personal insights.

It's harder to manage and mantein this type of blog, but I'm willing to face the challenge to improve readability and interation, but I will also post at least a summary of all posts on my [Medium page](https://rafaelbg27.medium.com) where I also share more personal texts, non related to data science.

Hope you like my posts and find it useful! ;D 

Feel free to [contact me](https://rafaelbg27.github.io/contact), and add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelbg27/)!
