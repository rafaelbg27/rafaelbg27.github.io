Hi! My name is **Rafael Bernardes Gonçalves**, and I'm creating this blog to share some data science projects and personal insights.

It's harder to manage and mantein this type of blog, but I'm willing to face the challenge to improve readability and interation.

I also have a [Medium page](https://medium.com/@rafaelbg27) where I post more personal texts, non related to data science.

Hope you like my posts and find it useful. Feel free to [contact me](https://rafaelbg27.github.io/contact), and add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelbg27/)!
