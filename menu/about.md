Hi! My name is **Rafael Bernardes Gon√ßalves**, and I'm a Electronic Engineering student from Brazil.

I'm passionate about innovation, technology and data science and love the power and range that data can have in almost every field and the way it can be used to improve results and make people's life better.

If you'd like, you can download my (hopefully) updated resume [here](https://github.com/rafaelbg27/rafaelbg27.github.io/tree/gh-pages/assets/resume.pdf).

My social medias are on the icons floating somewhere on the website, but I'd like to share some random links:
